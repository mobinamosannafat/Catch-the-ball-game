# Catch The Ball Game

Implementation of the Catch the ball game with the help of JS.

## Rules of the game

You should click on the running ball and catch it! In every click, the distance between the position you clicked on it and the position of the ball will be calculated.
If the sum of the calculated distances during the 12th click is less than 2500, you win and a new window for factorial calculation opens, but if the number of clicks reaches more than 18 or before the 12th click, the total calculated distance is more than 2500, you lose!
